## Shillings in Serverless

Serverless is a great platform and lambda is an amazing technology, but how many of us as architects who propose elastic and scalable solutions, and how many of us as enthusiastic engineers who implement serverless applications, have ever spared a thought on how much it would actually cost to run those solutions every month? In this talk, we will go through the fundamentals of the serverless pricing, that every engineer should be aware of, for the most common services such as lambda, API gateway and DynamoDB. 

In this light hearted talk, we will start by looking at the basic characteristics of serverless and then explore to understand the costing of a solution in a step by step manner. With easy to understand and simple real world scenarios, we will delve into the details of the plain lambda pricing, the effect of API gateway and the imbalance of DynamoDB. We will even attempt to look at the ever challenging but intriguing debate on serverless vs containers and the tradeoffs. With the understanding of the cost, we will briefly touch upon the tools available to help us with the cost estimation before diving into look at few factors to consider while architecting serverless applications. 

At the end of this talk, everyone will walk away with the awareness of the cost implications of serverless and some of the best practices to follow. Remember, pennies do add up!

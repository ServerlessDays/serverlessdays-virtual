## Single Table DynamoDB for AppSync

One DynamoDB table or many? There's a popular myth that when you use DynamoDB with AppSync you need to use a multiple table architecture. The justifications for this include a lack of flexibility, needing to understand your access patterns, and requiring massive up front design. 

In this talk I'm going to show you how to implement AppSync using a flexible single table DynamoDB architecture that requires almost no up front design work and is flexible enough that it will easily evolve with your schema.

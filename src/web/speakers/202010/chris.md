## Six Years of Serverless, or why I’ve forgotten how to SSH

As we round past 6 years since AWS Lambda was first announced we’re now past those early awkward years of a new industry paradigm. Today serverless application philosophy is being adopted by companies of all shapes and sizes, for workloads big and small. Some, don’t even have any servers to manage at all. Is there a new generation of developers who will never use SSH? 

In this session we’ll revisit some of our earlier years and look at how we’ve seen this space grow and change. We’ll also be real; about the challenges, the still to be solved problems, and what bumps in the road still trip people up.

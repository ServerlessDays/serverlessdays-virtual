    bio: "Hannah first attended JeffConf in 2017, before it was called Serverless Days, as she was interested in Serverless technology and keen to learn more. She hadn't yet started her career as a web developer but felt the possibilities were exciting. Since then she has become a Junior Application Engineer at The LEGO Group working as part of a full stack product squad. She is currently deepening her knowledge in React and GraphQL and is also continuing her serverless journey by exploring the world of AWS. "

## How we are continuously improving our serverless standards at The LEGO Group

The Shopper Engagement Technology Team at the LEGO Group started writing serverless services back in 2018. Since then our services have been through a couple of iterations to bring them up to date with evolving best practices. 

This talk will centre on our most recent efforts to bring our services up to date and on what our areas of focus are and why. We will discuss our Serverless Audit and how we adapted it with the release of the AWS Serverless Lens as well as the mixed responses from the product squads. We will then go into detail about how we are creating feedback loops between the squads to ensure continuous improvement across the platform.

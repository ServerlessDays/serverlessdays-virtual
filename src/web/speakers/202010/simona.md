## Serverless at the end of the Universe

Serverless functions are extremely good at what they do and provide planet-scale computing power for your applications. The one thing where serverless functions fall short is when it comes to state management. When missing state management abilities building up complex flows in your data processing will prove to be quite daunting, and most often than not will require you to provide custom mechanisms for enabling you to communicate between your functions. 

I am here to explain the challenges and what we can do to tackle them in a way that is extensible and suitable for production environments.
